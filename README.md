# Blade-of-Sacrifice-Classic
The repository of an RPG Maker game I made when I was 10! Why did I make it a GitHub repository? Because Discord didn't like the file size without Nitro, that's why! Also... a remastered version featuring a CD soundtrack and full voice acting is coming soon-ish! You're welcome!

Now, about installation. You'll need to download the RPG Maker XP RTP at https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/run-time-package to play, but then you'll be able to play many of the future titles I release on here :3

Gabe, you're welcome. Please upload a public video of this updated game on your YouTube channel and I'll link it in this repository!
